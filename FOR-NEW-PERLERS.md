# For New Perlers

If you're reading this file, you fit in to one of three groups:

1. You're new to Perl, and you may have questions.
2. You're not new to Perl, and you may be curious about what this file is.
3. None of the above.

Since Perl is a language that many folks don't have experience with, I figured
I would address some of the more obvious questions for those who are new.

For my fellow Perlers, please excuse my mistakes in this file, and feel free
to offer corrections and expand this document.

## Learning Perl

So, teaching you Perl is obviously outside the scope of this document. Suuuper
outside the scope of this project. However, there are some excellent tutorials
and learning materials I can reference. Keep in mind that I learned Perl before
the web was lousy with tutorials, I used what we then affectionately referred
to as "dead tree coffins" (books). There are some _excellent_ books, and I think
the one I would recommend the most is the [_Perl Pocket Reference_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/perl-pocket-reference/9781449311186).

Here are some other recommendations:

- [Beginning Perl](https://www.perl.org/books/beginning-perl/)
- [Learn Perl](https://learn.perl.org/)
- [The Perl.org Free Online Library](https://www.perl.org/books/library.html)
- [Try Perl](http://tryperl.pl/)
